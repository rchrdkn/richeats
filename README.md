# RichEats

I was bored and hungry one day, but didn't know what to eat - so I decided to code up a little project to help keep track of recipes.

Built with a [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) frontend and a [Sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity) backend.

## Getting started

Note: This project includes a `.nvmrc` file with the version of node used to develop it, any other versions may not work.
